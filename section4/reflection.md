## Section 4 Reflection

1. How different did your workflow feel this week, considering we asked you to follow the Pomodoro technique?
Im still working on this technique. I feel it helps sometimes, but other times I feel I need to stay in a certain problem for longer and taking a break may not help. I'll continue to work on it...

1. Regarding the work you did around setting intentions in Step 1 of the Pomodoro technique - how did that go? Were you surprised by anything (did you find yourself way more focused than you realized, more distracted that you thought you'd be, estimating times accurately or totally off, etc)?
It was fine. No surprises...

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An Object is datatype used for storing collections, or things that can be defined by a set of characteristics. i.e. Car, (make, model, engine, gearbox, etc.)
1. For each set of data, would an array or object be better to store it? Explain your choice.

  * List of all of the students in class - Array: all elements are the same datatype.
  * List of states and their capitals - Array: again, same datatype. String, "State, Capital".
  * List of things to pack for vacation - Array or Object... Depends if a simple list, or if you wanted to break it down into sections like "Tops", "Bottoms", "Accessories", etc...
  * Names of all the Instagram accounts I follow - An Array. Basic datatype.
  * List of student names and their cohort - Array: same datatype.
  * Ingredients and amount of each ingredient to bake a cake - Object: Cake is the object, all the ingredients could be the properties. The properties could be amended as the recipe is changed.
  * All my favorite restaurants - Array: same datatype, "string". Unless you wanted to add more deatil like, type of food, address, opening hours, etc...

1. In this section, we talked about an `transaction item object`. It has keys that represent different properties an bank transaction would have, and values that store the data. In a banking app, this data would eventually be displayed in the browser for the user. Think of another Object in a web application that you use frequently. What is it? What keys might be on it? What are example values?
I immediately think of a car buying website. The Car is the object, and when you are narrowing your search you would input various example key value pairs such as, age, (age range), mileage,(mileage range), doors, (2, 4, 5), colors,, (red, white, blue, etc.), physically on site, (true/false), etc... to narrow down your search and then have the appropriate cars displayed in your browser.

1. What questions do you still have about classes and/or Objects?
Quite a few... This was obviously the most difficult section, and I feel I need to a majority of my time before Mod 1 working on this section... Nothing too difficult, but it is a lot of information to try and learn AND retain...
