## Section 2 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I think i'm somewhere in between. After the first 2 mod0 sessions I was struggling a bit and scared to ask a question for fear of seeming stupid, but as we got into the 3rd session and I realized others were in the same boat as me it became fine.

1. In this section, we removed some of the supports that you had in Section 1. We didn't give the directions for how to run a file in node, and really sent you off to learn about functions by exploring several outside resources. How did that feel? What was uncomfortable about it? How did it support your learning?

It was fine. I went back in my Terminal to run the node exercises. It was little uncomfortable, but definitely made me think more. I think the pacing is just right.

1. What is a conditional statement? Give one example of a daily life conditional. Give one example of where a conditional is probably used in a web application you use.

Conditional statements tell the computer to one thing or another thing based on a set of simple criteria.
##Example of a daily life conditional:
If today is Tuesday, then tomorrow is Wednesday, (true).
##Example of a web application:
When you enter your password to access a website, (If correct you can log in, if incorrect you cannot).

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an `if` statement? In your own words, explain how to program reads them and determines what to do.
You would add 'else if', and 'else'. You must start with the 'if' statement first though.
Only 1 of the conditions can have its instructions run, so if the 'if' statement is true javascript will not look at the 'else if', or 'else'. Once the code block runs, that is it.

1. What tools are available to you, as a developer, if you want to check that TWO conditions are met? Or, if you want to check that 1 of 2 conditions are met, before running a block of code?
Conditional operators - ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=
Logical operators - && or ||

1. What questions do you still have about `if` statements and/or functions?
Nothing specific, little questions come up as i'm working through the sections, but normally figuring out the exercise or googling helps me stay on track.
