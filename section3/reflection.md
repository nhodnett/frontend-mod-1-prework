## Section 3 Reflection

1. What are two points from the Growth Mindset article and/or video that either resonated with you, or were brand new to you?
One thing that resonated is being open to feedback. Sometimes I feel i can react to feedback as if it is criticism. I have gotten better with this though.
Another thing is understanding that mistakes are ESSENTIAL to learning. I do not like making mistakes, and often interpret them as failing or not being good enough. I have to learn to accept them and use them as learning opportunites.
1. In which ways do you currently demonstrate a Growth Mindset? In which ways do you _not_?
##Ways I do:
I seek out challenges, and I am not afraid to seek help.
###Ways I do not:
I struggle to focus on the process. I am fairly goal orientated, so sometimes the process is not as important to me as the result...
1. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.
I play a couple of games where names on the leaderboard are held in an array.
1. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.
An Array is a special type of variable that can store a list of values, typically related to each other.
1. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?
The purpose of a loop is to instruct code to run a specified number of times. It is useful to use with an array if you want to run the same code for each item in the array.
1. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?
Loops are used to repeatedly run a block of code - until a certain condition is met.
1. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?
For the 3rd to last task in loop-arrays.js, (doubling the numbers, line 37 of my code), I had to search high and low for that answer, as I couldn't find it in the course material or the book anywhere, was that the idea, or did I miss something?
