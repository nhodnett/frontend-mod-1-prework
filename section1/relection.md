## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?
## Things I already do:
Teach others what I know - hopefully this doesn't come across as mansplaining.
Take care of my brain - I eat a healthy diet, including blueberries, vegetables and whole-grains.
## Things I plan to start doing:
Adopt a growth mindset - focus on my goals.
Read more - I need to keep reading to acquire more knowledge.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.
String - Can consist of numbers, letters, characters, wrapped in "" or '', (front and back should match).
Number - Can be whole, decimal, minus, large, small.
Booleans - Can only take the value true or false. Always lower case, mostly used for conditional testing.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?
console.log("Hello World")

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?
// or /*
Comments allow us to add information for other developers in our code in our written/spoken language, as well as let us de-activate parts of our code that we want to temporarily keep from running.

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is a name, (keyword), for a storage location used to help define something that might be used later.

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?
####Instagram
name = String
password = Boolean
saved items/favorites = Boolean

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Concatenation - A programming term that allows us to join multiple variables together to form a String or sentence.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatention?
Facebook - in your profile, (name, age, address, email)

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)
Q: It seems that sometimes spacing is important in the code, but other times it is not? Why is this?
Q: With concatenation, i'm a little confused on where the + signs and the "" go to make sure it is correct and will run in console.log. I have played with it to figure it out, but I am not seeing a definite pattern yet. I will continue to play with it.
